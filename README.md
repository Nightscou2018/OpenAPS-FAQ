How to use this document: ctrl + F to search for your keywords (plans to add it into an FAQ tool with better search, but for now it's just a list)

There are a few basic places where things can go wrong: 
- OpenAPS rig hardware
- OpenAPS rig software
- NightScout Software
- Pump Hardware
- Dexcom Hardware
- Dexcom Software / Cloud

Start Here: 
Something isn't working -


If none of this works go to http://gitter.im/nightscout/intend-to-bolus to ask for help -- the best way to get an answer is to ask a specific question. Rather than "my rig isn't working, what should I do?" - "My OpenAPS software isn't looping -- here is the error message (img or `text`) -- so far I've tried x, y, z" -- this will help the most possible people be able to understand your question and provide possible solutions.
